# Getting and Cleaning Data

*Project aim:

Preparation of tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

*Project plan:

1. Download the raw data to local drive as zip file. 
2. Unpack the zip file and set UCI HAR Dataset folder as working directory.
3. Create the R script called run_analysis.R which:
- merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
4. Generate a new file with tidy data as txt file in working directory.
